# Default Grafana Dashboards for Kubernetes

This repository contains the default Grafana dashboards for Kubenetes.

To add new or modify existing, download the JSON representation of the dashboard (in Grafana use Shared > Export JSON) and create a new file in the root of this repository, or to update an existing dashboard simple overwrite the dashboard file.

Then commit and push changes, and within 15 minutes Grafana will pick up the changes.
